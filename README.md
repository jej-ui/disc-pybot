# Discord Python Bot

This repository was created for the sole reason of being as 'a basic template' a discord bot.

What does it do?


# Requirements

**Python 3.5.3 or higher is required.**

Install Python on https://www.python.org/.

If you're new to Python, that's great! However, it is highly suggested to start
off learning Python, it is an easy, simple and useful programming language. It
is never late to begin coding! You don't need a computer science degree for that.

**discord.py module**

```bash
# Linux/macOS
python3 -m pip install -U discord.py

# Windows (on cmd, after you've installed Python)
py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py
```

**A text editor**

There are many available text editors you can find on the web. I'd recommend
using **atom.io**, but any text editor will do! Even the regular Notepad, but
don't use it, *just don't*.

Read the comments in `bot.py`, make any changes that you wish. Have fun!
